## Features

- Fly through a tunnel of realtime Bluesky posts
- Do a barrel roll, use the boost, you know the drill
- Watch your health, if crash into 3 posts it's game over

## Controls

- **WASD**: Move Arwing (W/S: up/down, A/D: left/right)
- **Shift**: Boost
- **Ctrl**: Brake
- **Space** or **Left Click**: Fire lasers
- **AA/DD**: Barrel roll (double-tap A or D)

## How it works

- React + TypeScript frontend with Vite build system
- Node.js server serves static files and acts as WebSocket relay
- Connects to Bluesky's Jetstream API and forwards messages to frontend clients
- 3D visualization using Babylon.js
- Interactive flight controls and shooting mechanics
